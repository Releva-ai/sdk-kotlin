# SDK Release Guide

Complete guide for releasing new versions of the Releva SDK.

---

## Quick Reference

### TL;DR

```bash
make release VERSION=1.0.1
```

That's it! The Makefile handles everything: clean, test, build, version update, commit, tag, and push.

### What Happens

When you run `make release VERSION=x.y.z`:

1. ‚úì Cleans build artifacts
2. ‚úì Runs all tests
3. ‚úì Builds the SDK
4. ‚úì Updates version in `build.gradle.kts` and `README.md`
5. ‚úì Commits and pushes changes
6. ‚úì Creates and pushes git tag
7. ‚úì Triggers JitPack to build and publish

### Verification

1. **Check JitPack**: https://jitpack.io/#Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin
   - Wait for green ‚úÖ checkmark
2. **Add GitHub release notes**: https://github.com/Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin/releases

---

## Overview

The Releva SDK is distributed through [JitPack](https://jitpack.io), which builds the SDK directly from GitHub releases. JitPack automatically creates Maven artifacts from your GitHub tags.

**SDK Repository**: https://github.com/Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin
**JitPack Page**: https://jitpack.io/#Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin

## Releasing a New Version

### Prerequisites

- Clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- All changes tested locally
- Version number decided (see [Semantic Versioning](#semantic-versioning))

### Using Make (Recommended)

```bash
make release VERSION=1.0.1
```

### Manual Release

If you need manual control:

```bash
# 1. Clean and test
make clean
make test
make build

# 2. Update version numbers
vim releva-sdk/build.gradle.kts  # Update version
vim README.md                     # Update version

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin main

# 4. Create and push tag
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin 1.0.1
```

---

## Semantic Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### Version Guidelines

**MAJOR** (x.0.0) - Breaking changes requiring developer action
- API changes that break existing code
- Removed features or methods
- Changed behavior affecting integrations

**MINOR** (1.x.0) - New features (backward compatible)
- New methods or classes
- New functionality that doesn't break existing code
- Deprecations (with backward compatibility)

**PATCH** (1.0.x) - Bug fixes (backward compatible)
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Documentation updates

### Examples

```bash
# Patch release (bug fix)
make release VERSION=1.0.1

# Minor release (new feature)
make release VERSION=1.1.0

# Major release (breaking changes)
make release VERSION=2.0.0

# Pre-release (beta testing)
make release VERSION=1.1.0-beta
```

### Version Examples

```
1.0.0 ‚Üí Initial release
1.0.1 ‚Üí Bug fix (e.g., fix crash in push notifications)
1.1.0 ‚Üí New feature (e.g., add wishlist tracking)
2.0.0 ‚Üí Breaking change (e.g., rename RelevaClient methods)
```

### Pre-release Versions

For testing before official release:

```
1.1.0-alpha    ‚Üí Alpha testing
1.1.0-beta     ‚Üí Beta testing
1.1.0-rc1      ‚Üí Release candidate 1
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check JitPack Build

After releasing, verify the build succeeded:

1. Go to: https://jitpack.io/#Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin
2. Find your version in the list
3. Wait for the status icon:
   - üîÑ **Yellow**: Building (wait)
   - ‚úÖ **Green**: Build successful
   - ‚ùå **Red**: Build failed (click for logs)

### 2. Test in Example App

Update the example app to use the new version:

```bash
cd ../shopping-android-app

# Update build.gradle.kts
sed -i 's/com.github.Releva-ai:sdk-kotlin:[0-9.]*/com.github.Releva-ai:sdk-kotlin:1.0.1/' app/build.gradle.kts

# Build and test
./gradlew clean build
./run-on-device.sh
```

### 3. Update Documentation

After a successful release:
- Add release notes on GitHub
- Update CHANGELOG.md (if you maintain one)
- Update integration documentation (if API changed)

## Makefile Commands

```bash
make help                  # Show available commands
make build                 # Build SDK
make test                  # Run tests
make clean                 # Clean artifacts
make release VERSION=x.y.z # Release new version
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### JitPack Build Fails

**Check build logs:**
1. Go to https://jitpack.io/#Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin
2. Click the ‚ùå icon next to your version
3. Review the error logs

**Common issues:**
- Gradle/Kotlin version issues (check jitpack.yml)
- Compilation errors (test locally with `make build`)
- Missing dependencies (verify build.gradle.kts)

**Fix and re-release:**
```bash
# Fix the issue
git add .
git commit -m "Fix build issue"
git push

# Delete old tag
git tag -d 1.0.1
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1

# Re-release
make release VERSION=1.0.1
```

### Wrong Version in build.gradle.kts

```bash
# Update manually
sed -i 's/version = "[0-9.]*"/version = "1.0.1"/' releva-sdk/build.gradle.kts

# Commit and re-tag
git add releva-sdk/build.gradle.kts
git commit -m "Update version to 1.0.1"
git push

# Delete and recreate tag
git tag -d 1.0.1
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin 1.0.1
```

### Tag Already Exists

```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d 1.0.1

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/1.0.1

# Create new tag
git tag -a 1.0.1 -m "Release version 1.0.1"
git push origin 1.0.1
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: Only do this for unreleased or broken versions. Never delete tags that developers are using!

### JitPack Cache Issues

If JitPack shows old version:

1. Visit: https://jitpack.io/#Releva-ai/sdk-kotlin/1.0.1
2. Click "Look up" button to force rebuild
3. Wait for new build to complete

   - Test with the example app
   - Verify on real devices if possible

2. **Version Carefully**
   - Follow semantic versioning strictly
   - Be conservative with major version bumps
   - Document breaking changes clearly

3. **Communicate Changes**
   - Write clear release notes
   - Mention breaking changes in bold
   - Provide migration guides for major versions

4. **Don't Rush**
   - Take time to test thoroughly
   - Review code changes before releasing
   - Consider beta versions for major changes

5. **Keep History**
   - Never delete released tags
   - Maintain CHANGELOG.md
   - Document all version changes

## Advanced Topics

### Multiple Release Branches

For supporting multiple major versions:

```bash
# Create release branch for v1.x
git checkout -b release/1.x
git push -u origin release/1.x

# Release from specific branch
git checkout release/1.x
make release VERSION=1.0.5
```

### Hotfix Releases

For urgent bug fixes:

```bash
# Create hotfix from tag
git checkout -b hotfix/1.0.1 1.0.0

# Fix bug
git commit -am "Fix critical bug"

# Release hotfix
make release VERSION=1.0.1

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/1.0.1
git push
```
